# ðŸ§  Basic HTTP Server in Python (Beginner Project)

This project is a simple HTTP server written **from scratch using raw Python sockets** â€” no frameworks, no dependencies. It's a hands-on way to learn how the web works under the hood.

## ðŸš€ Why I Built This

I'm learning Python and networking fundamentals by building small, focused projects. This HTTP server helps me understand:

- How HTTP requests and responses work
- How sockets handle communication between a browser and server
- How basic routing and file serving is implemented manually
